# Basic Calculator 

## Breif synopsis of website

This project is a HTML, JavaScript and CSS technology created site created using googleapis fonts and styles.
I have used Git and GitHub for version control.  

## UX - User experience

This is a basic calculator used to add, subtract, divide and multiply.

## Technologies used

The project uses HTML as the project main technology, JavaScript to enable the user to have an interactive experience and CSS to style.
AWS as the project framework to create the files index.html, style.css and script.js
Git and GitHub are used for version control, I pushed my project from AWS to Github to save new features and code. 
I regularly saved my work and ensured it worked after it was saved each time. 

I conducted UAT after each push to GitHub and after each re login to AWs as well as once deployed.
I tested by individually selecting each feature and ensuring that the page was rendering correctly with all expected code working as intended.
