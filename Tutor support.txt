No problem. Can you tell us a little bit about what you're trying to achieve?
Hello, I am have just submitted my interactive project. The browser was showing my work before submitting and now it is not. The code works as I have checked on AWS popping out to the browser.
I am also having with Github as I keep receiving an error message each time I try to push
Could you please provide a link to either your GitHub of your GitPod work space that you could share with us so we can have a look at the issue?

Thanks! Next, to help our team provide the best advice, Is there any error message that you're seeing? Is it giving you any indication of what may be causing the issue?
Any screenshots that you can provide would be most welcome. :)

this is the message I keep getting on Git when I try to push.....
Please can you help? Thank you

Can you tell us what you've tried so far to try to fix the issue? 
Any screenshots of what you've tried so far would also be really helpful. 😀
I have not tried to fix it as I am not sure how.....
Operator profile
Where are you currently thinking the issue is coming from? 
not sure.....
Operator profile
Great, just one last question here. :)
What can we do to best help you troubleshoot the issue here?
Please keep in mind that as tutors, we're here to help provide you with guidance on how to tackle the issue, however, tutors will not solve the problem for you. 
not sure?
I have looked on slack before I came to the tutors
Operator profile
Great, thanks for sending that on. We'll be with you as soon as we can! 
Our current tutoring hours are:
Monday - Friday: 24 hours
Saturday/Sunday: 9am - 5pm (UTC)
great thank you
I had to manually add my files to git hub instead of linking from bash terminal as they will not sync?
Operator profile
Please note that during periods of high volume, especially after 20:00 on weeknights, and on weekends, that it may take us a bit longer than normal to respond. We appreciate your patience, and we will respond as soon as we are able. 
Haley profile
Hi there, thanks for your message. Can you provide me with the following info here please: 
Are you working on AWS C9 or GitPod?
If you do git remote -v in your terminal, what do you see?
When you manually added files to github, how did you go about doing this? Did you do it via the terminal or via the GitHub site itself?
Hi Haley,
I am on AWS
If I do git remote -v I see this:
origin lolalongo11 (fetch)
origin lolalongo11 (push)
I manually added by adding and saving the code into the files themselves
I saved my code into notepad and then dragged and dropped
the 3 files
html script and css
Haley profile
Hmm, okay, normally it would say something like this 
origin https://github.com/hschafer2017/my_repo_name
strange. I did clone to link up at first but it just does not seem to be working. I did the same thing as when I created my other project which worked fine.
Haley profile
If you run the command git log --oneline , what do you see? 
If you don't see any of your commits there, you can do the following commands in this order: 
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/lolalongo11/calculator-.git
git stash
git pull origin master
git stash pop
ok, I have done the following commits in that order as I did not see any of my commits
Okay, great. So when you did git pull, did you see more files pop into your workspace?
Haley profile
If so, now try `
git push -u origin master
and you should be all set. :) 
this is what I get.....

Hi there, Anna here. So sorry for the delay in getting to your question. As usual the tutor tab has been very busy this evening.
Anna profile
Have you googled this error message to see if you can find a guide to solving it?
Hi Anna, No worries at all. Sorry for my late reply, I was just getting my 2 year old fed bath and off to bed. I have tried googling but with no luck.
Ah yes I know how that is! I was getting my 5yo to do the same thing before I started my evening shift.
I have a saved response here I wrote a while ago to help walk you through a git pull. I will find it for you.
Anna profile
Sometimes there are conflicts between your github repository and your local one. This can happen because you made a change directly on github, or because you are working from two computers or IDEs. Here is how to do a git pull and fix and merge conflicts:
In the terminal type git pull origin master . This pulls your files from GitHub
Type git status to see which files have a conflict that needs fixing.
Then check those files and look for places marked with #### or <<<<. These are the areas that differ between your local files and the Github ones. Correct these areas until the code is how you need it to be.
Save all the files you changed.
Then in the terminal type git add .  (don't forget the . that will add all the files changed since the last time they were committed.
Then git commit -m "fixed merge conflict"  You will know the merge is complete because (master | MERGING)  will return to just (master)  in the terminal
Finally git push origin master so all your files are synced up.
Hi there 😀 I have tried all that and this is the result, still getting an error message....

Anna profile
Ok I think that failed because you still had some files that were not committed before you tried to do a git pull. I think you have committed them now, can you do a git status to check that there are no files waiting to be committed?
hi there, yes working tree clean it says
I have tried again and the same issue:

Ok, can you try the git pull process again please? I think the original git pull failed because you had uncommitted files.

I'm just checking in to let you know that I'm finishing up tutoring support for the day. 
If you reply to this message, your question will be added back into the queue and another tutor will get in touch with you (please do not create another conversation). Alternatively, I will check back in with you when I'm back online.

Our current tutoring hours are:
Monday - Friday: 24 hours
Saturday/Sunday: 9am - 5pm (UTC)

Hi there! 
Sammy here for Anna as shes finished up for the day - thank you for waiting here! 
Having a look at those error messages, can I get you to try 
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
Samantha profile
And then merge changes after that as you were trying for a start :)

Hey! Let me know if you can see this chat now from the Tutor Tab? We'll continue the chat here from the existing conversation if that's okay?
Hi yes, I can see this
that is great thank you
I'm just going to put that last messages you sent here as well.



BTW I should add this is for my project submission that I have sent in...

I also am having issues cloning to git:

It sounds like you're in AWS Cloud9, based off of   ubuntu:~/environment(master)   is that correct?
yes that is right
Tim profile
No problem!
Can I also just check, that this is the repository that you're working with on cloud9?
https://github.com/lolalongo11/calculator-
Hi there, yes thats the one
Okay... let's try a few things in that case. Sorry for the back/forth coming up. It's not as simple with AWS Cloud9 vs using Gitpod where we can see the code live.
Tim profile
git remote -v
What shows up on there?

Cool! So we've got the right repo, that's a good start.

Tim profile
Woohoo!!! Your GitHub repo was updated with 6 additional commits now!
you are a genius!!!
Any idea what I did wrong?
Tim profile
So now... whenever you're making any changes on your project.... there are only 3 commands you need to remember.



git add --all
git commit -m "Whatever commit message here"
git push origin master


--all      this is a better version of    git add .      because it includes all files and sub-folders.
You can do git add and then each file individually if you'd like, but I tend to use git add --all myself
ok cool thank you so much 😀
Tim profile
You're very welcome! 😁

Is there anything else I might be able to assist with?
No thank you, you have been awesome!
Tim profile
No problem at all! I'll let the two lovely ladies from last night know as well.
All the best going forward, and glad you're able to push on now!
Take care 👋😁
Brilliant, cheers 😀
Just now. Seen
